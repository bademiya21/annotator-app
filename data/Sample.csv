What is the status of the performance review of the unqualified """"""""Senior 
Principal Estate Executive"""""""" requested over 5 weeks ago on 13th June?
WHO have you assigned as an independent reviewer from OUTSIDE the Woodlands 
branch to assess the work ineptitude of the “Senior Principal Estate Executive” 
and the ENTIRE SHAMBOLIC BRANCH under the incompetent management of the 
substandard """"""""Senior Principal Estate Executive"""""""".

branch to assess the work ineptitude of the “Senior Principal Estate Executive”.




Do you hire your “Senior Principal Estate Executive” straight out 
of kindergarten  So completely devoid of even an iota of rationality it’s 
risible Primary school education was even completed.




The July 7th reply from the “Senior Principal Estate Executive” to my 23rd June 
email was a utter farce.




First the “Senior Principal Estate Executive” had no understanding of the word 
‘Must’.

Now the “Senior Principal Estate Executive” demonstrated no grasp of how 
questions and answers work.

How the “Senior Principal Estate Executive” is NOT ASHAMED to sign off as 
“Senior Principal Estate Executive” is beyond the pale.




There were no less than 30 question marks in my 23rd June email.

You do know what “?” represents right or do you need a child to educate you on 
that as well? 

“Senior Principal Estate Executive” DID NOT ANSWER A SINGLE QUESTION.




Instead, once again, “Senior Principal Estate Executive” INEXPLICABLY GAVE 
IRRELEVANT INFORMATION.




Did I ask about the occupancy status? NO!!!

It’s completely IRRELEVANT and I couldn’t care less if the unit was occupied. 

It’s IMMATERIAL. HOW ARE YOU NOT GETTING THIS???

(I don’t even know why it takes you 2 weeks (23/06-7/7) to find out that the 
owners have moved in - I knew that way before 7th July.)

Really. What is wrong with the “Senior Principal Estate Executive”? 

Does the “Senior Principal Estate Executive” have ADHD? 

Throw in a medical assessment along with that work performance review!

Was the “Senior Principal Estate Executive” EVER competent in any capacity?




I CANNOT keep going round and round in circles with these jokers. 




7th July email from “Senior Principal Estate Executive” alleging “We have 
earlier replied to you on the matter.” is a LIE.

There was NO reply to my 23rd June email PRIOR to the dismal 7th July email.




Is this the kind of “quality service” you as Quality Service Manager advocate?

Lies, questions not answered, tardy rate of response, no understanding and 
implementation of HDB rules, no repercussions for failure to enforce 
regulations, etc.




Please get someone NOT FROM the Woodlands branch to not only assess the “Senior 
Principal Estate Executive” but review this whole fiasco as well. DO NOT just 
send this email straight back to the Woodlands “Senior Principal Estate 
Executive”. If I wanted that, I could have done so directly without you (QSM). 
How can you have someone so unqualified for the “Senior Principal Estate 
Executive” position be in charge of the Woodlands branch??? Absolute disgrace.

Subject:	Fwd: New Ubin Seafood
Re:? Ubin Seafood at 63 Hillview 
Dear Honourable PM Lee 
Thank you for directing/referring? this case to URA and NEA? 
My name is Jimmie Tay and I am a resident of Blk 55 #02-11 Parc Palais Singapore 598752 
There are a total of 517 units of residential homes in Parc Palais?
 
 There are 195 units of residential homes in Blk 53 and Blk 55 alone. These residential homes are located closer to Ubin Seafood or Lam Soon which have been very badly affected by the smell and noise since day 1 of the operation of UBIN Seafood at Lam Soon. 
There is a signed petition of 112 units from blk 53 and Blk 55 regarding the smell and the noise. This petition shows how the large majority of residents are seriously and badly affected by the noise and smell. As you know, most Singaporeans are apathetic unless they are affected.? 
? 
Therefore, I am surprised by the reply of Ms Smita Choudhuri from URA dated 17JUL17 
 ? 
Also? this email QTE?

Dear Ms Caureen Too /Mr Eddy Lim 
? 
I refer to your emails dated 20-03-2017 and 22-03-2017.? 
? 
The canteen at the 6th storey of the Lam Soon building is an approved use which has been operating since the 1980s. Our checks show that the premises is currently being operated as a canteen serving primarily the factory workers although it is also open to the public.?Ubin Seafood is one of the food stalls operating in the canteen in line with the approved use and the premises is not considered a restaurant.?? 
? 
With regard to your feedback on fumes and smell etc, the operator has to comply with NEA's licensing requirements which we understand NEA has already liaised with the operator to take improvement measures.? We also wish to clarify that business operation matters such as the type of food sold and opening hours etc. are up to individual food operators to decide and not subject to planning controls. 
? 
Thank you 
?

?????????? UNQTE 
? 
I wonder if Ms Smita has visited the said restaurant in the evening during operating hours as her email dated 31March17 to consider it as a canteen and not a restaurant.???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? As any patron or customers going to Ubin Seafood will tell you, this is a restaurant and not a canteen. Pls see link ??http://sethlui.com/new-ubin-seafood-singapore/ 
? 
The smell from the exhaust fans is still ongoing . Mr Tan and his team from NEA is in communication with me to deal with this issue and will keep you updated when the issue is totally resolved or whether we need your further assistance. 
 As for our noise concerns, all the operator has done is to put up notices to remind their patrons to keep their volume down and officially shortened their operating hours to?10pm. These hardly help because they do not stop their patrons from talking loudly or staying beyond?10pm.? 
? 
The question on the minds of our residents is whether The URA considered the consequences and effect of issuing a restaurant license to the New Ubin Seafood Restaurant before the license was issued or was the license issued without consideration for the 517 or more residents and then treating the matter as a?fait accompli?and taking cosmetic steps to be seen to be doing something, albeit useless steps when complaints arise just to be seen to be doing something. 
? 
Many residents have complained to the police about the noise level since the opening of the restaurant. Imagine the waste of precious manpower resources because of the non-consideration of the URA on the effect of the restaurant on the tranquility enjoyed by the residents in this area. These resources can be put to to better use. 
? 
May we suggest that the URA either revoke the license or as a compromise, require the restaurant to install air-conditioning / enclose the restaurant so that the noise can be contained within the restaurant, rather than have an open concept. In this way, the restaurant can continue to operate and the noise from the restaurant can be reduced to an acceptable level. It will be very difficult if not impossible for the restaurant to stop its patrons from speaking loudly, especially when it is crowded. Hence, the compromise. 
? 
The posters/Notices approach that the restaurant has adopted, which the URA appears to accept, does not reduce the noise generated at ALL. 
? 
Our residents just want our peace back so that we can rest properly in our place call HOME when we get back from work. 
Lastly i would personally like to thank Mr Tan and his team from NEA to be very proactive to coming down to our units not one but more than 6 units of HOME to understand what we are facing and work on the problems we face with the operator.? 
? 
We shall be grateful if you can consider our suggestion.? 
? 
Thank you.

?Best Regards
